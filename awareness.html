    <h2>What is Cerebral Palsy?</h2>
    <p>Cerebral Palsy is a condition that affects a person's ability to move, maintain balance and posture. It is a disorder that affects the part of the brain that controls a person's ability to control his or her muscles. <strong>Cerebral</strong> means having to do with the brain and <strong>Palsy</strong> means weakness or problems using the muscles.</p>
    <h4>Types of Cerebral Palsy</h4>
    <p>CP is classified according to the movement type disorder by doctors, depending on which areas of the brain are affected.<br>There are 4 main types of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html">Cerebral Palsy(CP)</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spastic Cerebral Palsy</li>

    <h4>Misconceptions About Cerebral Palsy</h4>
    <p>In Kenya there are many kids with CP disorder, but finding them is quite tha task. For regions that are not well informed about the disorder, they usually associate CP to witchcraft. This is the number cause of stigma associated with CP. Most of the families that have children with CP are usually shunned and treated badly because of misinfromation for example, for the children who develop the disorder like a month or so after birth.This is normally seen as an act of witchcraft, given the manifestation of the symptoms after child birth.</p>
    <p>It is time to stop the stigma about CP. It's a disoder that affect anyone in our society, and its time to speak about it boldly. Locking up our children in the houses or treating people badly is not the solution. We as a community can always lend a helping hand. This can only be achieved through the power of information!</p>
    <p>Children with CP have an equal right to everything just like all the other normal kids. They have a future that can be worked upon by a people and community who support and love nad. Disability is not inability, or the end of life. It surely is not easy, but doable all the same. Let us work through a brighter future for our kids.</p>
