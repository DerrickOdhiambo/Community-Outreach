        <h6>TREATMENT AND INTERVENTION</h6>
        <p class="awareness">Cerebral Palsy cannot entirely be treated but it can be controlled.
            It is important to note that each person with the condition has an entirely different treatment plan. In order to get a suitable one, seek medical advice.
            <ul>Here are some of the ways of dealing with the condition:
                <li>Medication. This helps lessen muscle tightness, improve functional abilities as well as reducing pain.</li>
                <li>Therapies.
                    There are four types of therapy that can be used to deal with the condition.
                    <ol>
                        <li class="underline">Physical therapy.<br>
                            Muscle and training exercises can help the child's strength, flexibility, balance, motor development and mobility.
                        </li>
                        <li class="underline">Occupational therapy.<br>
                            This helps the person gain independence in daily activities and routins in the home, school and community.\
                            Even driving is possible in some cases after this therapy!
                        </li>
                        <li class="underline">Speech and language therapy.<br>
                            This improves your child's ability to speak clearly or communicate using sign language.
                            Use of communication devices such as computers and voice synthesizers is also taught if need be.
                        </li>
                        <li class="underline">Recreational therapy.<br>
                            Some children benefit from regular or adaptive recreational or competitive sports activities.
                            They help to improve the person's motor skills, speech along with their emotional well being.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Surgical procedures.
                    In some cases surgery is necessary on bones to place them in their correct positions or lengthen muscles or tendons.
                    These corrections can reduce pain and improve mobility.
                </li>
