      <h2>What is Cerebral Palsy?</h2>
      <p>Cerebral Palsy is a condition that affects a person's ability to move, maintain balance and posture. It is a disorder that affects the part of the brain that controls a person's ability to control his or her muscles. <strong>Cerebral</strong> means having to do with the brain and <strong>Palsy</strong> means weakness or problems using the muscles.</p>
      <h4>Types of Cerebral Palsy</h4>
      <p>CP is classified according to the movement type disorder by doctors, depending on which areas of the brain are affected.<br>There are 4 main types of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html">Cerebral Palsy(CP)</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spastic Cerebral Palsy</li>
        <li>Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy</li>
        <li>Ataxic Cerebral Palsy</li>
        <li>Mixed Cerebral Palsy</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Misconceptions About Cerebral Palsy</h4>
      <p>In Kenya there are many kids with CP disorder, but finding them is quite tha task. For regions that are not well informed about the disorder, they usually associate CP to witchcraft. This is the number cause of stigma associated with CP. Most of the families that have children with CP are usually shunned and treated badly because of misinfromation for example, for the children who develop the disorder like a month or so after birth.This is normally seen as an act of witchcraft, given the manifestation of the symptoms after child birth.</p>
      <p>It is time to stop the stigma about CP. It's a disoder that affect anyone in our society, and its time to speak about it boldly. Locking up our children in the houses or treating people badly is not the solution. We as a community can always lend a helping hand. This can only be achieved through the power of information!</p>
      <p>Children with CP have an equal right to everything just like all the other normal kids. They have a future that can be worked upon by a people and community who support and love nad. Disability is not inability, or the end of life. It surely is not easy, but doable all the same. Let us work through a brighter future for our kids.</p>

    <div class="treatment">
      <h2 class="text-capitalize">treatment and intervention</h2>
        <p class="awareness">Cerebral Palsy cannot entirely be treated but it can be controlled. It is important to note that each person with the condition has an entirely different treatment plan. In order to get a suitable one, seek medical advice.
        <ul>Here are some of the ways of dealing with the condition:
          <li>Medication. This helps lessen muscle tightness, improve functional abilities as well as reducing pain.</li>
          <li>Therapies.
            <p> There are four types of therapy that can be used to deal with the condition:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><span class="underline">Physical therapy.</span><br>Muscle and training exercises can help the child's strength, flexibility, balance, motor development and mobility.</li>
              <li><span class="underline">Occupational therapy.</span><br>
                This helps the person gain independence in daily activities and routins in the home, school and community.<br>Even driving is possible in some cases after this therapy!</li>
              <li><span class="underline">Speech and language therapy.</span><br>This improves your child's ability to speak clearly or communicate using sign language. Use of communication devices such as computers and voice synthesizers is also taught if need be.</li>
              <li><span class="underline">Recreational therapy.</span><br>Some children benefit from regular or adaptive recreational or competitive sports activities. They help to improve the person's motor skills, speech along with their emotional well being.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Surgical procedures. In some cases surgery is necessary on bones to place them in their correct positions or lengthen muscles or tendons. These corrections can reduce pain and improve mobility.</li>
        </ul>
