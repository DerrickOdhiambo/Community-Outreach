        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>CPSP is a Self Help Group(SHG) serving the needs of children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) and other disabilities.It was begun by a mother who had her first child with cerebral palsy.  Her situation of needing support to raise her one and only son and getting none, had her look for mothers with similar children. This was when she noted that a good number of mothers could not afford the frequent therapies, needed nutritional foods and medicines for their children. With that she began sourcing for support from friends and colleagues to help meet these needs a support program kind of. She began doing Cerebral palsy awareness by organizing CP fun days, then free/affordable therapy sessions once a month with the help of volunteering physiotherapists after which they were provided with home supplies basically food and pampers. She has created a community for CP children and families. However, our long term goal is to build a Support Centre, this will help free up parents/caregivers, to provide care and monitor kids progress.<p>
